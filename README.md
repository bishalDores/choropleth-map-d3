** <strong>topojson library is used</strong> **

######Sample user stories:
* My choropleth should have a title with a corresponding id="title".
* My choropleth should have a description element with a corresponding id="description".
* My choropleth should have counties with a corresponding class="county" that represent the data.
* There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties.
* My counties should each have data-fips and data-education properties containing their corresponding fips and education values.
* My choropleth should have a county for each provided data point.
* The counties should have data-fips and data-education values that match the sample data.
* My choropleth should have a legend with a corresponding id="legend".
* I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
* My tooltip should have a data-education property that corresponds to the data-education of the active area.<br>
